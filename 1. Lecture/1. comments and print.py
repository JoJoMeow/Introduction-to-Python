# This is an example Comment, the '#' tells Python to ignore the following text
# comments can be used to clarify complex code or for other purposes, for example:
# TODO: if a comment starts with TODO it will get highlighted by the pycharm IDE which can be quite useful

# the following is a default print Statement in Python, the text to be printed can be added in between (" ")
print("Hello World")

# numbers (without any text) can also be printed without the ""
print(1)

# you can also do a 2 line print statement without having to write print() twice
print("Hewwo \nCheese")  # the  \n basically means 'new line' which will be inserted at the exact same position

# an alternative for multiline print statements is using ("""""")
print("""
This is something you shouldn't use if you don't have to
but hey it's still good to know that the possibility exists
(Note: you can also start directly after the triple quotation marks, 
this text will have a empty line before and after it)
""")

# triple quotation marks can also be used to form multi line comments
"""
This is a multi line comment, 
in specific cases triple quotes will be used as doc-strings which will be discussed at a later point
be aware that this is only a comment because it is not inside a print statement 
and because it isn't assigned to anything else via a '='
